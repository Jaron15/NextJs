# NextJs
** NOTES **

In this demo application I create an application with NextJs paired with a mongoDB backend. I use Nextjs tools like Static Site Generation, Server Side Rendering, getStaticProps, Nextjs folder structure for dynamic paths and api routes, the Head component for meta data (imporoves Search Engine Optimization), etc.

The app acts as a way for people to schedule and share meetup events. The initial page has a list of the current added events with a show details button below it, if that is clicked the user is taken to the detail page of that listing that will contain more information. A user can also add their own listing by navigating to the Add New Meetup link in the navigation, then entering in the information in the form. The listing will then be loaded onto the homescreen with all of the other listings.
